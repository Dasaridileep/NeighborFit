# 📌 Problem Definition: NeighborFit

## 🧠 The Problem

People relocating to new cities often struggle to find neighborhoods that match their specific lifestyle preferences. Factors such as affordability, safety, access to public transport, greenery, and nightlife play a critical role in quality of life — yet there's no easy way to compare neighborhoods across these dimensions.

## 🔍 Research Findings

Through informal user interviews and online research, we identified:

- Users typically rely on hearsay or real estate agents for neighborhood recommendations.
- Many prioritize safety and transport but also care about greenery and social life.
- Existing platforms like 99acres and MagicBricks lack lifestyle-based filtering.

## ❓ Hypotheses

1. **Users prefer personalized recommendations** over general listings.
2. **Lifestyle preferences vary significantly by city and profession.**
3. **A simple scoring model** can help users shortlist better options faster.

## 🧪 Validation Plan

- Create a preference form for users to input their priorities (1–10 scale).
- Implement a matching algorithm and validate results through testing.
- Track logs to observe patterns in user inputs (for future improvement).
