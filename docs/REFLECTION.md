```markdown
# 🔎 Reflection & Learnings: NeighborFit

## ✅ What Worked Well

- Simplicity of algorithm made debugging easier
- Clean React + Express setup
- Easy to expand by adding more neighborhoods
- Logging user queries helped analyze patterns

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Data is manually entered, not from live sources
- UI is functional but can be made more polished
- No user login system or personalization

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Use a real-time database like MongoDB or Firebase
- Integrate Google Places or Map APIs for live data
- Enable user feedback on match accuracy
- Introduce heatmaps for neighborhood comparisons

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

This project reinforced skills in:
- Problem decomposition
- Full-stack integration
- Working under constraints
- Writing clean, modular code
